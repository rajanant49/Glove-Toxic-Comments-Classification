# Toxic Comments Classification Using pre-trained Glove Embeddings

Detection of toxic nature of comment using the toxic comment dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data)

Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.

We are provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:

- toxic
- severe_toxic
- obscene
- threat
- insult
- identity_hate

Model is created using Stanford's pre-trained glove 6B embeddings.Global Vector or GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words.

This model has been trained with :
glove.6B.100d.txt - 6 Billion token and 100 Features
